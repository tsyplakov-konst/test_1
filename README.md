heart test
1. Data Collection
Pulse Measurement: Utilizing built-in sensors (e.g., in smartwatches or fitness trackers) to measure heart rate.
ECG: The ability to connect to devices that can perform electrocardiograms for more accurate heart rhythm analysis.
Physical Activity Data: Integration with other applications or devices to obtain information about the user's physical activity (e.g., steps, workouts).
2. Heart Condition Analysis
Rhythm Monitoring: Analyzing heart rate data to identify anomalies such as arrhythmia.
Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Assessment: Determining stress levels and overall health based on heart rate variability.
Comparison with Norms: Comparing collected data with established norms to identify potential deviations.
3. Notifications and Recommendations
Problem Alerts: Automatic notifications to the user about potential issues, such as excessively high or low heart rates.
Personalized Recommendations: Providing advice on improving heart health, including exercise, diet, and stress management techniques.
4. Data Visualization
Graphs and Reports: Visualizing collected data in the form of graphs and reports, allowing users to track changes in heart condition over time.
Data History: Storing historical measurements for analyzing the dynamics of heart condition.
